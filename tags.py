I'll give you some dialogue conversations. Your task is to analyze and understand them to classify each dialogue statement into one fo the corresponding 4 tags: 
question, response to a question, statement, or an instruction. The dialog conversations are such that a response for a question posed can come after many statements too. 
It is like a natural, group conversation where any user can reply to any message that was sent any time in the past. Based on this information, classify the tags of the 
entire dialogue sequence. Write the classified tag first, and then reason it in a maximum of 100 words. 
The format should be strictly as follows: <sentence_id>: <Classification>. <Reason For Classification>
